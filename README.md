# FEW 2.5 Working with Data

## Answering questions with Data

The values in a dataset tell a story. Reading the story is the process of sorting, filtering, and looking at the data in different ways. 

## Learning Objectives

- Extract data from a dataset using: map filter and reduce
- Calculate the maximum, minimum, and average values
- Dervive unique values from a list
- Use array.map()
- Use array.filter()
- Use array.reduce()

## Getting started

This example code uses Jest as the test runner. Install it with: 

`npm  install`

## Run the tests 

Then run the tests: 

`npm test`

Write your code, and run the tests to see if your methods are working. The tests will all fail at the start. Your goal is to make each method return the expected value. 

## Challenges 

Take a look at `challenges-1.js`. This file has some functions stubs that where you will add your own code. Each of these functions takes one or more parameters. 

All of the functions take `data` as the first parameter. This parameter will be the data from `titanic-passengers.json`. Given the Titanic data the goal of your code is to return the relevant values. You can add helper/utility functions if you like.

Some of the functions take another parameter such as the class a passenger traveled in or their gender. You might be asked to find the number of passengers that match this parameter. 

Later we will be using libraries to handle some of these operations for us. For this assignment you should write the code yourself with vanilla JS to get an idea of what is going in those libraries. Think of these problems as practice for interview questions. 

Each of the function stubs in `challenges-1.js` has a comment describing what the function should look for and return. Your job is to write the code to make this happen.

Run the test suite to check your work. 

## Looking at the Titanic JSON

The data from the Titanic dataset is stored as an array of objects. Each object in the array has the same fields with different values. 

```JS
[{ // <- Passenger Object begins here
  "datasetid": "titanic-passengers", 
  "recordid": "398286223e6c4c16377d2b81d5335ac6dcc2cafb", 
  "record_timestamp": "2016-09-20T15:34:51-07:00",
  "fields": { // <- Fields begins here
    "fare": 7.3125, 
    "name": "Olsen, Mr. Ole Martin", 
    "age": 40.0,
    "embarked": "S", 
    "parch": 0, 
    "pclass": 3, 
    "sex": "male", 
    "survived": "No", 
    "ticket": "Fa 265302", 
    "passengerid": 155, 
    "sibsp": 0,
    "cabin": "F4"
  } // <- Fields ends here
}, // <- Passenger Object ends here
...
]
```

At the top level, there are four keys

- `datasetid`
- `recordid`
- `record_timestamp`
- `fields`

The first three are not really important to us for these examples. All of the information that is useful to us is held under the `fields` key.

Under `fields` there are the following keys: 

- `fare` - The amount paid for a ticket
- `name` - Name of passenger
- `embarked` - Port of embarkation
  - `"C"` = Cherbourg, `"Q"` = Queenstown, `"S"` = Southampton
- `parch` - # of parents/children aboard
- `pclass` - Passenger class
  - `1` = 1st Class, `2` = 2nd Class, `3` = 3rd Class
- `sex` - Passenger gender
  - `"male"` or `"female"`
- `survived` - Survival
  - `"No"` or `"Yes"`
- `ticket` - Ticket Number
- `passengerid` - Passenger id
- `sibsp` - # of Siblings spouses aboard
- `cabin` - Cabin number 

Not all records have all of the data. Some are missing one field or another. There might some cases where you'll need to filter out records that are missing a value.

## Use Array.filter() to find matching records

Use `Array.filter()` to find records that have a matching value. Filter returns a new array with only the matching items. 

If you need a count you can use the length of the new array. 

Examples: 

```JS
// Find passengers by gender 
const malePassengers = data.filter((passenger) => {
  return passenger.fields.sex === 'male'
})

malePassengers.length // number of male passengers
```

Filter expects you to reutrn true if you want to include the record in the filtered array or false if the record should not be included. 

In the sample above `passenger.fields.sex === 'male'` evaluates to true this passenger is included in the filtered array. 

## Use Array.reduce() to get a single value from all records

Use `Array.reduce()` to reduce an array to a single value. Reduce takes array and creates a single value from all of the elements in the Array. 

```JS
// Find the total of all fares paid
const totalFares = data.reduce((acc, passenger) => {
  return acc + passenger.fields.fare
}, 0)
```

If we remove the code in the callback from the example above it would look like this: 

```JS
const totalFares = data.reduce((acc, passenger) => {}, 0)
```

Notice the last parameter `0`. Important! This is needed here since it defines the starting value used by reduce. 

Notice the callback passed into to reduce. 

```JS
(acc, passenger) => {
  return acc + passenger.fields.fare
}
```

The callback takes two parameters: `acc` and `passenger`. The first: `acc` is the accumulator, or running total. While the second: `passenger` is passenger object from the array. The return is value if the accumulator plus the fare the passenger paid. The return value becomes the new accumulator the next time the function is run. 

## Use Array Map to transform an array

Array Map is used to transform an array. Use it to turn an array of one kind into an array of another kind. For example, the data array us an array of objects, to find the max and min values we need an array of numbers. The code below does this: 

```JS 
const allFares = data.map(passenger => passenger.fields.fare)
const maxFare = Math.max(...allFares)
```

The second line uses `Math.max()` to find the greatest value. This method takes a variable number of parameters, for example: 

```JS
Math.max(56, 23, 78, 94)
```

The `...` is the spread operator, use it to break an array apart into seprate parameters. 

```JS
Math.max(...[56, 23, 78, 94])
```
